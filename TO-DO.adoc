== Fix

- Footnote links don't work in the Cervantes 3 reader with the latest
  version of Asciidoctor EPUB3. They work on Calibre and fbreader
  viewers.
- The XHTML tag `<sup>` has no effect in the Cervantes 3 reader.
- Description of the effect of "-men" in chapter "Accentuation": it's
  the adverbial ending.

== Improve

- Confirm "Li pòríu".
- Move the original "(*)" notes to footnotes?
- Naming of the current edition: "ti edition (digital)" -> "ti-ci
  edition"?
- Improve the explanation about the accent of "-men": make clear it's
  about the adverbial ending, in a footnote.

== Add

- Add optional conversions to Markdown and HTML.
- Add annex with all of the "al-", "ne-", "-cunc" words in a table?
- Prepositions not included: "circa", "córam", "for" (it's mentioned
  in "ab-", and also as an interjection, but not explained; it's
  mainly an adverb, but it's included by Matejka in his list of
  prepositions); "except" (included by Matejka in his list).
- Footnote in §70 about "fe"?
- Add "demí-" to §128.
